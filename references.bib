The proposed knowledge based genetic algorithm incorporates the domain knowledge into its specialized operators, where some also combine a local search technique. The proposed genetic algorithm also features a unique and simple path representation and a simple but effective evaluation method. The knowledge based genetic algorithm is capable of finding an optimal or near-optimal robot path in both complex static and dynamic environments. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed genetic algorithm is demonstrated by simulation studies. The irreplaceable role of the specialized genetic operators in the proposed GA for solving robot path planning problem is demonstrated by a comparison study.},

In this paper, we introduce a novel replanning method for symbolic planning with heuristic search-based planners, currently the most popular planners. Our SHERPA replanner is not only the ﬁrst heuristic search-based replanner but, different from previous replanners for other planning paradigms, it also guarantees that the quality of its plans is as good as that achieved by planning from scratch. We provide an experimental feasibility study that demonstrates the promise of SHERPA for heuristic search-based replanning.},

Therefore, an improved A* algorithm is presented in this paper. Firstly, a new environment modeling method is proposed in which the evaluation function of A* algorithm is improved by taking the safety cost into account. This results in a safer path which can stay farther away from obstacles. Then a new path smoothing method is proposed, which introduces a path evaluation mechanism into the smoothing process. This method is then applied to smoothing the path without safety reduction. Secondly, with respect to path planning problems in complex terrains, a complex terrain environment model is established in which the distance and safety cost of the evaluation function of the A* algorithm are converted into time cost. This results in a unification of units as well as a clarity in their physical meanings. The simulation results show that the improved A* algorithm can greatly improve the safety and smoothness of the planned path and the movement time of the robot in complex terrain is greatly reduced.},

GA has been widely used to generate an optimal path by taking advantage of its strong optimization ability. While conventional random mutation operator in simple GA or some other improved mutation operators can cause infeasible paths, the proposed mutation operator does not and avoids premature convergence. In order to demonstrate the success of the proposed method, it is applied to two different dynamic environments and compared with previous improved GA studies in the literature. A GA with the proposed mutation operator finds the optimal path far too many times and converges more rapidly than the other methods do.},

Since the robot motion planning problem is generally an NP-hard problem, metaheuristics such as GA are proper approaches to solve it. Therefore, a new adaptive method based on GA is proposed to solve this problem. In order to overcome the local-trap problem and avoid premature convergence, a novel selection operator is designed. In our model, in each iteration, if necessary, the selective pressure is updated by using feedback information from the standard deviation of fitness function values. This adaptive model helps the proposed method better maintain the diversity of individuals and escape from the local optima. We experimentally compare the proposed method to three other state-of-the-art GA-based approaches. The experimental results confirm that our proposed algorithm outperforms the related methods in terms of solution quality and finding an optimum path.},

We investigated both exact and heuristic methods. We contributed with the design, analysis, evaluation, implementation and experimentation of several algorithms for grid map path planning for both exact and heuristic methods. We also designed an innovative algorithm called relaxed A-star that has linear complexity with relaxed constraints, which provides near-optimal solutions with an extremely reduced execution time as compared to A-star. We evaluated the performance of the different algorithms and concluded that relaxed A-star is the best path planner as it provides a good trade-off among all the metrics, but we noticed that heuristic methods have good features that can be exploited to improve the solution of the relaxed exact method. This led us to design new hybrid algorithms that combine our relaxed A-star with heuristic methods which improve the solution quality of relaxed A-star at the cost of slightly higher execution time, while remaining much faster than A* for large-scale problems. Finally, we demonstrate how to integrate the relaxed A-star algorithm in the robot operating system as a global path planner and show that it outperforms its default path planner with an execution time 38\% faster on average.},

By adopting a complexity-theoretical perspective, he derives general limitations for black-box optimization, yielding lower bounds on the performance of evolutionary algorithms, and then develops general methods for deriving upper and lower bounds step by step.

Collision-free planning of the robot motion path is studied, and a means to adjust the machining frame on the belt is determined (i.e. moving along the axis of the belt and rotating around the tangent line). The planning curve is rapidly found on the collision layer using neighborhood search and recursive methods, and the amount of collision detection is significantly reduced. The planning curve is transformed into the robot motion path. Simulation and experimentation show that the amount of collision detection required by the proposed algorithm is 3.86\% less than that required by a method using a complete collision layer. Moreover, the robot grinds the workpiece without collision. The proposed method is simple, stable, and easy to implement and possesses a good engineering application value.},

Co-operation amongst the individual robots’ evolutionary algorithms ensures generation of overall optimal paths. The other feature of the algorithm includes local optimization using memory based lookup where optimal paths between various crosses in map are stored and regularly updated. Feature called wait for robot is used in place of conventionally used priority based techniques. Experiments are carried out with a number of maps, scenarios, and different robotic speeds.

We show that this problem can be handled by appropriate refinements of methods introduced by A. Tarski [“A Decision Method for Elementary Algebra and Geometry,” 2nd ed., Univ. of Calif.

Our method, which is also related to a technique outlined by J. Reif [in “Proceedings, 20th Symposium on the Foundations of Computer Science,” pp. 421–427, 1979], also gives a general (but not polynomial time) procedure for calculating all of the homology groups of an arbitrary real algebraic variety.

	abstract = {In this new era of "big data", traditional DBMSs are under attack from two sides. At one end of the spectrum, the use of document store NoSQL systems (e.g. MongoDB) threatens to move modern Web 2.0 applications away from traditional RDBMSs. At the other end of the spectrum, big data DSS analytics that used to be the domain of parallel RDBMSs is now under attack by another class of NoSQL data analytics systems, such as Hive on Hadoop. So, are the traditional RDBMSs, aka "big elephants", doomed as they are challenged from both ends of this "big data" spectrum? In this paper, we compare one representative NoSQL system from each end of this spectrum with SQL Server, and analyze the performance and scalability aspects of each of these approaches (NoSQL vs. SQL) on two workloads (decision support analysis and interactive data-serving) that represent the two ends of the application spectrum. We present insights from this evaluation and speculate on potential trends for the future.},

	abstract = {Scientiﬁc facilities such as the Advanced Light Source (ALS) and Joint Genome Institute and projects such as the Materials Project have an increasing need to capture, store, and analyze dynamic semi-structured data and metadata. A similar growth of semi-structured data within large Internet service providers has led to the creation of NoSQL data stores for scalable indexing and MapReduce for scalable parallel analysis. MapReduce and NoSQL stores have been applied to scientiﬁc data. Hadoop, the most popular open source implementation of MapReduce, has been evaluated, utilized and modiﬁed for addressing the needs of different scientiﬁc analysis problems. ALS and the Materials Project are using MongoDB, a document oriented NoSQL store. However, there is a limited understanding of the performance trade-oﬀs of using these two technologies together. In this paper we evaluate the performance, scalability and fault-tolerance of using MongoDB with Hadoop, towards the goal of identifying the right software environment for scientiﬁc data analysis.},

	abstract = {Continuous Integration (CI) is a popular practice where software systems are automatically compiled and tested as changes appear in the version control system of a project. Like other software artifacts, CI speciﬁcations require maintenance effort. Although there are several service providers like TRAVIS CI offering various CI features, it is unclear which features are being (mis)used. In this paper, we present a study of feature use and misuse in 9,312 open source systems that use TRAVIS CI. Analysis of the features that are adopted by projects reveals that explicit deployment code is rare—48.16\% of the studied TRAVIS CI speciﬁcation code is instead associated with conﬁguring job processing nodes. To analyze feature misuse, we propose HANSEL—an anti-pattern detection tool for TRAVIS CI speciﬁcations. We deﬁne four anti-patterns and HANSEL detects anti-patterns in the TRAVIS CI speciﬁcations of 894 projects in the corpus (9.60\%), and achieves a recall of 82.76\% in a sample of 100 projects. Furthermore, we propose GRETEL—an anti-pattern removal tool for TRAVIS CI speciﬁcations, which can remove 69.60\% of the most frequently occurring anti-pattern automatically. Using GRETEL, we have produced 36 accepted pull requests that remove TRAVIS CI anti-patterns automatically.},
